Started this project today@11PM.
chatGPT gave me set of requirement as follows:
1. Color pallet
2. App preffreence- mobile first backend heavy work without network
3. Members/trainers/admin pages
4. MOney tracker and notification reminders

MVP required as Version 1.0
  For Now (Version 1):
  Let‚Äôs just make an Admin Page ‚Äî that‚Äôs all I need.
  I don‚Äôt think members care about logging in and checking stuff yet. I‚Äôll show them their end date or plan if they ask. Right now, I just need:
  - Add/edit/remove members
  - Track payments  
  - Get alerts for renewals
  - Assign trainers
  - Keep workout notes

  Later, if members want to log in and track their own stuff, maybe we‚Äôll add that as a second version.

Update @2:25 AM

Update 9/5/2025 @11:14PM
Amongst india pak war and 12+ hours of forced blackouts, I got blacked out even more when while almost finishing the initial V1 of this APP chatGPT somewhere 
forgot that we can't update taiwind to V4 mid project and now everything crashed. Don't know how much time itll require to compensate for little help from chatGPT.
Lesson learned: chatGPT (AI) can't still take our job just make freshers like me more hardworking, guess what, It's game on üí™üèº

Update 11/5/2025
re started the setup, copied code from old to new folder and finnaly done with V1 of app. Also added suppport for dark and light mode meanwhile.
